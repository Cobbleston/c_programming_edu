Choose a Graphics Library:

Several good options exist:

SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer): Cross-platform, relatively easy to learn, good for 2D games.
SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library): Similar to SDL, object-oriented, also cross-platform.
GLFW: Focuses on window management and input, often used with OpenGL.
OpenGL/Vulkan/DirectX: For more advanced 3D graphics
GUI Libraries (Qt, GTK): Can be used for graphics, but are generally better suited for applications rather than games.
