0_HISTORY

-C uses 0 to mean FALSE and not 0 to mean TRUE;
-C external and static variables are initialized to 0 by default;

C is a general-purpose programming language that was originally designed
by DENNIS RITCHIE of BELL LABORATORIES and implemented there on a 
*PDP-11 in 1972. 

*PDP-11 is a series of minicomputers introduced in 1969 by the Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC). Made UNIX widely known and popular. The 
machine word size was 16 bits, and it was a general register architecture.


C was first used as the systems language for the UNIX operating system (OS).

KEN THOMPSON, the developer of UNIX, had been using both an assembler and a language name B to produce initial versions of UNIX in 1970.

C was invented to overcome the limitations of B.


0.1_WHY_C

C is a small language;
C is very portable;
C is terse;

C has a *built-in preprocessor that helps a programmer isolate any 
system-dependent code.

*The C preprocessor (CPP) is a text file processor that is used with C, C++
and other programming tools. The preprocessor provides for file inclusion
(often header files), macro expansion, conditional compilation, and line 
control. Although named in association with C and used with C, the 
preprocessor capabilities are not inherently tied to the C language. It can
and is used to process other kinds of files.

The preprocessor was introduced to C around 1973 at the urging of Alan 
Snyder and also in recognition of the usefulness of the file inclusion
mechanisms available in BCPL and PL/I. The first version offered file 
inclusion via #include and parameterless string replacement macros via
#define. It was extended shortly after, firstly by Mike Lesk and then 
by John Reser, to add arguments to macros and to support conditional 
compilation.

C has a very powerful set of operators, and some of these operators
allow the programmer to access the machine at the bit level.

The *increment operator ++ has a direct analogue in machine language on many 
machines.

* The increment operator (++) is used to increment the value of a variable
in an expression by 1. It can be used on variables of the numeric type such 
as integer, float, character, pointers, etc.
